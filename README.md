<h1>responsive-html-email-template</h1>

<h2>The process</h2>
<p>I followed along Dev Tips video on coding a responsive HTML email. I started out by creating a HTML file. All of the content goes in the div "email-background", it served as a container. Then within that div, I started creating the layout, I used an image and minimal text. I also included a call to action at the bottom of the template as well as a footer with usual HTML jargon. Separately, I created a CSS stylesheet and styled the template. The email container, which was the sub container that actually held the content, was set to a max-width of 500px so that it can be responsive. After I was done styling, I pasted my style in the HTML document under a style tag. I then used a CSS inliner tool called <a href="http://templates.mailchimp.com/resources/inline-css/>MailChimp"></a> which converted my css into inline css. As per Dev Tips, this is a very important step since some mail clients ignore style text. I then pasted my new html document with inline style to a NEW html document called index-style. I left the other documents as a reference. <p>
